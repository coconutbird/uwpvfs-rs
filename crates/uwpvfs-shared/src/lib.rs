//! Shared types and IPC protocol for UWPVFS
//!
//! Communication between CLI and DLL uses shared memory (file mapping).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The IPC system uses a ring buffer in shared memory for message passing:
//! - [`IpcHost`] - Created by CLI, owns the shared memory
//! - [`IpcClient`] - Opened by DLL, writes messages to the ring buffer
//!
//! # Message Protocol
//!
//! Messages use a packet-based protocol defined in [`messages`]:
//! - [`Packet`] - Variable-length message with header and payload
//! - [`PacketId`] - Message type identifier
//! - [`LogLevel`] - Severity level for log messages
